<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Height Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The height sensors market comprises two main types: contact and non-contact sensors. Contact type sensors physically touch the object to measure height, ensuring high accuracy but may wear over time. Non-contact type sensors use techniques like laser, ultrasound, or infrared to gauge height without physical interaction. This approach allows for faster measurements and is ideal for fragile items, although it may be less precise under certain conditions. Both types serve various industries, including manufacturing, logistics, and robotics.</p></p>
