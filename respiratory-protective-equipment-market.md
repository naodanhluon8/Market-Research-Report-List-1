<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Respiratory Protective Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>APR*</li><li>SAR*</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE) market is primarily divided into two main types: Air-Purifying Respirators (APR) and Supplied-Air Respirators (SAR). APRs filter contaminants from the air, allowing users to breathe safer air, making them ideal for environments with specific hazards. In contrast, SARs provide clean, breathable air from a separate source, offering protection in more hazardous situations where contaminants are too high for APRs. This differentiation helps determine the appropriate protective gear for various industrial and occupational settings.</p></p>
