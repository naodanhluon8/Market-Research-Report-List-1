<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tire Balance Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Clip-On Type</li><li>Adhesive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tire balance market primarily features two types: clip-on and adhesive weights. Clip-on weights are metal or plastic attachments that easily clip onto the rim of the wheel, providing a secure fit for balancing, often favored for alloy wheels. Adhesive weights, on the other hand, are sticky-backed and adhere to the inside of the wheel, making them less visible and ideal for maintaining aesthetic appeal. Both types effectively ensure smooth vehicle operation by minimizing vibrations and promoting even tire wear.</p></p>
